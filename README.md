MisfitGem
==========

Provides access to the Misfit Shine API (http://build.misfit.com) through oAuth.

As the Misfit Shine API is currently in BETA and under development, pull requests are appreciated if API support starts to show gaps.

## Installation

Install misfit_gem

```bash
$ gem install misfit_gem
```

or add it to your Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'misfit_gem'
```

## Authentication

Omniauth is the best way to connect your users to the Misfit API. Use [omniauth-shine](https://github.com/socialworkout/omniauth-shine) to integrate Misfit accounts into your web application. You will need the OAuth `access_token` as a minimum.

## Usage

Coming soon

## Disclaimer

I am not employed by Misfit. This gem was created to help ruby developers build applications on top of misfit.com's data.
